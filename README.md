## Model Training

The machine learning model was trained using a dataset containing historical sales data of video games.  
**Key features considered include:**
- Platform  
- Year of Release  
- Genre  
- Publisher  
- Critic Score  
- User Score  

A regression algorithm, such as **Linear Regression** or **Random Forest Regressor**, was employed to predict global sales figures.
